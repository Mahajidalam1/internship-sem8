                    <p><b>Architects of the Indian Constitution</b><br>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, (born April 14, 1891,
                        Mhow, India—died December 6, 1956, New Delhi), leader of the Dalits (Scheduled Castes; formerly
                        called untouchables) and law minister of the government of India (1947–51).<br>

                        Born of a Dalit Mahar family of western India, he was as a boy humiliated by his high-caste
                        schoolfellows. His father was an officer in the Indian army. Awarded a scholarship by the
                        Gaekwar (ruler) of Baroda (now Vadodara), he studied at universities in the United States,
                        Britain, and Germany. He entered the Baroda Public Service at the Gaekwar’s request, but, again
                        ill-treated by his high-caste colleagues, he turned to legal practice and to teaching. He soon
                        established his leadership among Dalits, founded several journals on their behalf, and succeeded
                        in obtaining special representation for them in the legislative councils of the government.
                        Contesting Mahatma Gandhi’s claim to speak for Dalits (or Harijans, as Gandhi called them), he
                        wrote What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (1945).<br>

                        In 1947 Ambedkar became the law minister of the government of India. He took a leading part in
                        the framing of the Indian constitution, outlawing discrimination against untouchables, and
                        skillfully helped to steer it through the assembly. He resigned in 1951, disappointed at his
                        lack of influence in the government. In October 1956, in despair because of the perpetuation of
                        untouchability in Hindu doctrine, he renounced Hinduism and became a Buddhist, together with
                        about 200,000 fellow Dalits, at a ceremony in Nagpur. Ambedkar’s book The Buddha and His Dhamma
                        appeared posthumously in 1957, and it was republished as The Buddha and His Dhamma: A Critical
                        Edition in 2011, edited, introduced, and annotated by Aakash Singh Rathore and Ajay Verma.

                    <p><b>Windows</b><br>Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on
                        November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had
                        captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use.[69] In August of the following year,
                        the
                        company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. <br>Although
                        the
                        two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership
                        deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[70] The operating system grew out of DOS in
                        an
                        organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid the DOS prompt by default. <br>Windows
                        XP,
                        released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO, was the first to not be based on
                        DOS.[71] Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the
                        firm
                        to John W. Thompson on February 5, 2014.</p>

                        alt="Biography">
                    <p><b>Biography</b><br>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist leader who was a key
                        figure in the Indian independence movement against British rule. He was born on January 23,
                        1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, India, to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. He came from a
                        well-educated and affluent family, and his father was a lawyer and a prominent leader in the
                        Indian National Congress.<br>
                        Bose received his early education at a local school in Cuttack, and later attended Protestant
                        European School in the city. He then went on to study at Ravenshaw Collegiate School in Cuttack.
                        In 1913, he passed the matriculation examination and in 1915, he passed the Intermediate
                        Examination with a scholarship. In 1916, Bose passed the entrance examination for the University
                        of Calcutta and was admitted to the Presidency College where he studied philosophy.
                        In 1919, Bose graduated with a first class honors degree in philosophy and was awarded the
                        prestigious Rajendra Prasad scholarship to study at Cambridge University. However, in 1920, he
                        failed the Indian Civil Services Examination. In 1921, Bose was re-appeared for the Indian Civil
                        Services Examination and passed, but resigned from his position in April 1921.<br>

                        Bose then joined the Indian National Congress and actively participated in the Indian
                        independence movement. He was a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, but
                        later broke away from them due to ideological differences. In 1939, he formed the Forward Bloc,
                        an organization aimed at unifying all the anti-British forces in India.
                        During World War II, Bose formed the Indian National Army (INA) with the help of the Japanese,
                        and attempted to overthrow British rule in India through an armed rebellion. However, the
                        rebellion was unsuccessful and Bose was arrested by the British. He subsequently escaped from
                        prison and fled to Germany, where he formed the Free India Centre and the Indian Legion, a group
                        of Indian soldiers who fought alongside the German army.<br>
                        In 1943, Bose left Germany and travelled to Japan, where he formed the Azad Hind Government and
                        declared war against the British. He also formed the Indian National Army (INA) which fought
                        alongside the Japanese in the Burma campaign.
                        In August 1945, Bose was killed in a plane crash in Taiwan. The exact circumstances of his death
                        are still shrouded in mystery and controversy, with some believing that he may have faked his
                        own death.
                        Bose was a charismatic leader who was deeply committed to the cause of Indian independence. He
                        is remembered as a national hero in India, and his legacy continues to inspire many Indians to
                        this day.

                        The comments made by reviewers fall, roughly into two categories: technical comments and
                        subjective/artistic comments. The elements in the "technical" category include rhythmic
                        "togetherness", intonation, errors or slip-ups, and so on. These elements are fairly "black and
                        white"; a pianist playing a concerto either played the right notes on a climactic scale run, or
                        she missed it. The subjective comments refer to elements which are a matter of taste.</p>

                    <h4>Bought review</h4>
                    <p class="mx-2">A bought review is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new product
                        pays a reviewer to review his new product. Primarily used in the car, movie, and game industry
                        this system creates a kind of undercover advertising. Bought reviews tend to be biased due to
                        the informative value of reviews. In some cases, a bought review may be independent, if the
                        person that is hired to do the review has a strong reputation for independence and integrity.
                        Even if a "bought review" from a respected critic is actually independent, the perception of
                        potential bias will remain, due to the financial relationship between the company and the
                        critic.</p>
