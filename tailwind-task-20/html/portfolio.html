    <h1>Html:</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
        HTML consists of a series of elements
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 
        HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

    <h1>CSS:</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
        In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.

    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web
        pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an
        interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

        JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the
        excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name
        LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other
        web browsers.

        The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

        JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
        Designed for creating network-centric applications.
        Complementary to and integrated with Java.
        Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
        Open and cross-platform
    </p>

    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level
        built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
        Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
        together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
        maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The
        Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for
        all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

    <h1>SQL</h1>
    <p>Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational
        database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different
        data attributes and the various relationships between the data values.
        SQL stands for Structured Query Language
        SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
        SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International
        Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved
        from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon
        which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the
        future continue to rely on Java, as well.

        While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are still many
        applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. Java.com,
        this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications – specifically
        applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should
        visit the dev.java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.
        Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

        It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

        It is used for:

        Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
        Desktop applications
        Web applications
        Web servers and application servers
        Games
        Database connection
        And much, much more!
